# Arithmetic Quiz

This is an implementation of an arithmetic quiz machine with HTML/CSS/Javascript.
It supports _random generation of binary arithmetic expressions_ and its related _collection of possible solutions_. The UI register the right and wrong questions, as well as the current score of correct aswers given by the user. A collection of tests enforces the correct behaviour of the UI using the _Jest/Puppeteer_ framework.
